The parts i worked the most are motors' control speed and how to combine between line follower and speed control, the idea behind adding the part of speed control was improving the stability of the robot by moving forward the two motors with the same speed using a PID regulator. So i think it's the most benefited part in this project compared to the first robot. 
PS: you need an arduino IDE and a solidworks software to see what this files contain.
